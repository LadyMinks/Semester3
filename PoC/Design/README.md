My first PoC is a small experiment with the DS18B20 Thermometer. I have decided to divide the folders into "code" and 
"pics". Pics can be ignored as they're just the pictures I used in the PDF. I have decided to not include any code in the "experiment" PDF, 
as they can be found in the "code" folder.
