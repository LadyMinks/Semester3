I wasn't really sure how it would go, working in a group, with other people. It was the first time I ever had to work together on a programming project. While I had heard of "agile sprints", I wasn't really sure what to expect.

We started this semester with sprints of two weeks. 

We used Git to make a sort of kanban board: ![Philadelphia's Magic Gardens. This place was so cool!](gitKanban.png "Philadelphia's Magic Gardens") It wasn't a proper kanban board, but we made some stories for each sprint and divided these into different colums such as, this sprint, in progress, ready for testing and done. 

It didn't work however, as planned. We are not sure if we weren't strict enough in our deadlines, or if the system itself wasn't very applicable to our project. We decided to plan a retrospective (very late albeit), and we realised we all felt the same about our system: it didn't work. ![Philadelphia's Magic Gardens.

We decided to use a new method; [INSERT PICTURE OF NEW KANBANBOARD], which took a lot of effort to set up everything properly, but did work a lot better than the git kanban board.
