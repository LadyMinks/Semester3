Shows how we are going to implement a micro-service architecture to realise our plans. The Alcoholic only uses the beer 
holder and the web application. The API application is able to communicate with the external processes from level 1.

# Integration Testing

While I understand the theory behind the integration testing, I am not sure about implementing them. This is definitely something I am going to look into this summer. I will be working on my 31 seconds android application, for which I did write quite a few unit tests, but would love to write some integration tests for those.
