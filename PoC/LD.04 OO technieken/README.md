## Modularity

Last semester I worked on an Android 30 Seconds application. I divided this  application into four different modules, a presentation layer, a business layer and a data layer and a "start-up" module. I actually thought this was a bit of an overkill for such a small application. I wanted to have three modules, with the presentation module serving as a start-up module, but that would mean there would be a dependency from the presentation layer to the storage layer but apparently that really was simply not done. 

## Loose coupling

I know this might not make a whole lot of sense, but I am going to add it anyway to give an idea of my project last year.
