# Semester 3 Portfolio

# Minka Firth

This my portfolio where I will update my progress this semester. 

## LD.01 [Ontwikkelmethodiek](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.01%20Ontwikkelmethodieken)

I think we all learned a lot from our mistakes, I am still unsure whether we didn't plan enough stories each sprint or if we just weren't strict enough in keeping to our sprints. I am not sure at what point, but somewhere along the line, it just stopped working for us. After having the retrospective, we decided for a different course. After this retrospective we found our drive again and it worked a lot better.


## LD.02 [Analyse](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.02%20Analyse)

The first level of the C4 model wasn't as difficult as I was afraid it'd be. This might be because I absolutely abhor making diagrams for code. However, the C4 model is quite self-explanatory. There aren't a shitload of arrows with a thousand arrowheads. When you look at it, it is immediately clear what the author meant with it. 


I only later realised that the acceptance test I wrote would not be applicable to the project anymore. I decided to leave them in there anyway, as it is still an added value to them to show I do understand how to make them. I've added a user story with acceptance criteria. 

## LD.03 [Design](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.03%20Ontwerp) 

This is not complete yet, but it is just a start into the C4 model, and a very brief start to an acceptance testplan. The C4 model is made around the bier.cool application. Only the first two levels are finished yet. There is also a hardware diagram in the C4 model style. 

Making the design diagrams for an application is probably my least favourite proces of any project. I find it very difficult to plan and decide how exactly I want to make my application, when I don't fully understand it myself. Fortunately we are working in groups now, which makes it a lot easier to understand and plan the diagrams.

However, working with the C4 model, was nowhere as daunting as usual UML. This might have something to do with the author of the C4 model telling his audience to not even bother with the last level (the most difficult one), but also because it is clear. There are no ambiguities like arrows having a shitload of arrowheads and another shitload of ways to direct them.    

While I understand the theory behind the integration testing, I am not sure about implementing them. This is definitely something I am going to look into this summer. I will be working on my 31 seconds android application, for which I did write quite a few unit tests, but would love to write some integration tests for those.

## LD.04 [OO-Technieken](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.04%20OO%20technieken)

I actually struggled with thinking of a proof of concept for this one. I decided to just reflect on the design patterns presentation, since this sort of dealt with loose and tight coupling. Last semester I really worked on the dependency inversion, and I really felt like I understand that because (for some reason) When I did semester 2 the first time, at the end of the semester, they asked about SOLID out of nowhere, and I had to do a lot of research into that and I am still reaping the benefits from that. 


## LD.05 [Design Patterns](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.05%20Design%20Patterns)

I actually really enjoyed doing a sort of research for Design Patterns, I kind of like comparing these patterns (Observer Pattern & Pub-sub Pattern). There was a lot of documentation for both of these patterns, and I really liked finding out the technicalities.  

## LD.06 Api & Communication Protocols

STILL TO DO


## LD.07 [Hardware](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/LD.07%20Hardware)

The first proof of concept that I tackled was a hardware "experiment" I tried out. I as actually really intimidated by hardware, thinking it to be something I could never do (or that I would immediately break the most important bits and bobs). But after asking Mitchell to send me in the right direction, it was, well not exactly easy, but simple and enjoyable. 

I connected two sensors with an esp to my laptop to see what freezer bags would be better at isolating the temperature around the sensor. While I expected to run into a lot of troubles or hick-ups, the biggest problem was actually connecting the esp with my laptop, since I had to download a certain drive to access it.  

This was a bit of an eye-opener for me, since it was my first experience with hardware, and I enjoyed it immensely. I really want to find out if this might be an area I might want to pursue.  

## LD.08 Versiebeheer

When I got into programming, my boyfriend made me download SourceTree. I have always used this to publish everything on Git. Especially now working in a team, this has been a gem. While I should probably know how to do this via the command line, Sourcetree is alot easier to work with for a Noob like me. 

Especially now that we are actually starting on programming the application, this has been very important, but we haven't run into any problems yet. 

## PO Oordeelsvorming / Communicatie / Leervaardigheden

**Communicatie**
This term I have really been looking to my fellow students for help regarding school. We have a lot of people with work experience in different areas, so there is always someone you can ask for help. It has also been very easy to ask for help. Whenever someone (often that someone would be me), would ask for more information, or a more detailed explanation, this was always received with enthusiasm and patience. 

For someone dealing with almost crippling fear of failure, this has been very comforting. While I am no longer afraid to ask for help, it is still quite daunting to admit I don't understand something as well as I should like. However, since it has never been received with exasperation or impatience, this has actually been going quite well.

**Oordeelsvorming**  
I always try to think about what I read. When doing the research for the design patterns, I found a few websites, all listing the same pros and cons for both the Observer and Pub-sub patterns. They would draw the same comparisons between them as well, they all had one source: Wikipedia. They even had the same alinea structure and I noticed some metaphors and anecdotes reappearing. I knew there were two conclusions I could take from these websites:
* These comparisons will probably be quite factual and true.
* I won't find a single original thought in any of them.

**Leervaardigheden**  
Next semester I am going to be stricter with myself and keep imposing deadlines (in the form of feedback conversations with teachers) to keep myself under pressure.
