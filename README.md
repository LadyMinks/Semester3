This my portfolio where I will update my progress this semester. 


## LD.03 [Design](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/Design) 

This is not completed yet, but it is just a start into the C4 model, and a very brief start to an acceptance testplan. The C4 model is made around the bier.cool application. Only the first two levels are finished yet. There is also a hardware diagram in the C4 model style. 

Making the design diagrams for an application is probably my least favourite proces of any project. I find it very difficult to plan and decide how I want to make my application, when I don't fully understand it myself. Fortunately we are working in groups now, which makes it a lot easier to understand and plan the diagrams.

However, working with the C4 model, was nowhere as daunting as usual UML. This might have something to do with the author of the C4 model telling his audience to not even bother with the last level (the most difficult one), but also because it is clear. There are no ambiguities like arrows having a shitlaod of arrowheads and another shitload of ways to direct them.    


## LD.06 Api & Communication Protocols

As far as APIs go, we have only worked on the documentation for the application. I think I want to add a little project to the bier.cool application, by looking into the Philips Hue API. I was thinking I might want to make my lights in the living room flash blue when the beer is cold enough. This is all still just in my head, and I have yet to get started on it. 


## LD.07 [Hardware](https://github.com/LittleMinks/Semester3/tree/main/PoC/Hardware)

The first proof of concept that I tackled was a hardware "experiment" I tried out. I as actually really intimidated by hardware, thinking it to be something I could never do (or that I would immediately break the most important bits and bobs). But after asking Mitchell to send me in the right direction, it was, well not exactly easy, but simple and enjoyable. 

I connected two sensors with an esp to my laptop to see what freezer bags would be better at isolating the temperature around the sensor. While I expected to run into a lot of troubles or hick-ups, the biggest problem was actually connecting the esp with my laptop, since I had to download a certain drive to access it.  

This was a bit of an eye-opener for me, since it was my first experience with hardware, and I enjoyed it immensely. I really want to find out if this might be an area I might want to pursue.  

## LD.?? Oordeelsvorming / communicatie / samenwerking

This term I have really been looking to my fellow students for help regarding school. We have a lot of people with work experience in different areas, so there is always someone you can ask for help. It has also been very easy to ask for help. Whenever someone (often that someone would be me), would ask for more information, or a more detailed explanation, this was always received with enthusiasm and patience. 

For someone dealing with almost crippling fear of failure, this has been very comforting. While I am no longer afraid to ask for help, it is still quite daunting to admit I don't understand something as well as I should like. However, since it has never been received with exasperation or impatience, this has actually been going quite well.
