# Semester3

In this Repository I will be uploading my Proof of Concepts and Portfolio.  

I have decided to seperate them into different folders. The PoC folder will be separated into the different outcomes. 
These are then seperated into different folders. 

#Hardware

My first PoC is a small experiment with the DS18B20 Thermometer. I have decided to divide the folders into "code" and 
"pics". Pics can be ignored as they're just the pictures I used in the PDF. Aside from that there are just a few Snapchat 
videos I sent to my friends to show off my hardware skills in there. I have decided to not include any code in the "experiment" PDF, 
as they can be found in the "code" folder. 

#Portfolio
